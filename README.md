# ctrl-dir-scroll package

This project is an [Atom](http://atom.io/) package.

It's meant to reproduce the Line Up/Down functionality of [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/) and SCI_LINESCROLLUP/DOWN functionality from [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/)

The desired behaviour is to have Ctrl-Up (Ctrl-Alt-Up on Mac, Linux) scroll the page a single line up, leaving the cursor in place.
When the cursor reaches the end of the page, it should scroll a single line as well to prevent it moving off the page.
The same should happen for Ctrl-Down (Ctrl-Alt-Up on Mac, Linux) but in the opposite direction.

Atom version 1.0 compliant thanks to [harai](https://github.com/harai)

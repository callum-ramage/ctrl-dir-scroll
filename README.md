# ctrl-dir-scroll package

This project is an [Atom](http://atom.io/) package.

It's meant to reproduce the Ctrl-Up & Ctrl-Down behaviour used in other editors like [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/).

The desired behaviour is to have Ctrl-Up scroll the page a single line up, leaving the cursor in place. When the cursor reaches the end of the page, it should scroll a single line as well to prevent it moving off the page. The same should happen for Ctrl-Down but in the opposite direction.
